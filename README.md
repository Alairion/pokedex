#Pokémon Origins' Pokédex
This files are scripts from the Pokémon Origins Fangame (French fangame: https://pokemonworkshop.com/forum/index.php?topic=201.0). I did it all. They are there to provide a script example of a performance critical interface under RPG Maker XP, using RGSS 1. 
Also note that these scripts are made public for "educational" purpose and nobody is allowed to use it as is. You can inspire yourself with the structure / algorithms used. Also note that these scripts were realized under PSP 0.8 (https://pokemonworkshop.com/forum/index.php?topic=256.0) and don't work. (Missing graphics ressources, ...)
